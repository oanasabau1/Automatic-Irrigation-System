# Automatic-Irrigation-System
The aim of this project is to create a automatic irrigation system in Arduino that will monitor the level of the soil moisture and start a water pump when the soil is too dry. Additionally, to ensure that the plant benefits from enough light,  a photoresistor will measure the light intensity.
