# Automatic-Irrigation-System
The aim of this project is to create a automatic irrigation system in Arduino that will monitor the level of the soil moisture and start a water pump when the soil is too dry. Additionally, to ensure that the plant benefits from enough light,  a photoresistor will measure the light intensity.

## Required components:

- Arduino Uno R3 development board
- Breadboard
- Module with 4 Relays, 5 V
- Capacitive soil moisture sensor, Elektroweb, 3.3 V
- Water pump, 6 V
- I2C LCD display
- Resistor, 10 kÎ©
- Photoresistance
- Battery, 9 V
- Battery connection bracket
- Connector wires
